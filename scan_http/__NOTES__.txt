The HTTP/HTTPS driver has 2 things to solve:

1) Get the version page and the artifact from the server.
Here it is important that the transport solution supports 301 redirects. This is not the case with Apache Ivy, so GitHub can not be used. It redirects to Amazon Cloud.

2) Parse the version page.
This should be a way to extract all available versions from the "version" page.
In a nutshell it should work like this: fetch page X which is defined in the repository configuration, parse it somehow and there you have all the available versions for an artifact.


Ideas for 2):
A first idea was to parse the page with expat and extract the versions with an XPath expression, but this is not good for 2 reasons:

* The page might not be valid XML. THis is still true for a lot of web-pages, especially looking at tags like "<br>", which are not always closed.

* An XPath expression depends strongly on one specific provider. It would not be one solution for all, and it would need additional parameters.

Another solution would be a simple regular expression to extract all links and their display names first. This list is parsed in a second step for version numbers.
The link and the display text must have the same version.
