* Add a link to the parent object in the resolve table. This is important for good error messages about one instance.
Example:
Error xyz in group/artifact/version required by
 G/A/V ->
   G/A/V ->
     G/A/V

* Recognize artifacts which were already processed before and do not resolve them again.
Be careful to create something which will also work with other resolvers than "exact".

* Store error messages or warnings for any resolve operations in the GA->V table.

* Store error messages for the resolve process in the resolve table.

* Combine the XML dumps of the resolve steps into one big XML.

* Add a stylesheet to view the big dumped XML.

* Add the system configuration to the XML dump.

* Add the project configuration to the XML dump.

* Add the GA->V table to each step of the XML dump.
